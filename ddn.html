      <p>This project was founded through Algonquin College's Applied Research Institute (ARI), where we created a proposal to work with Gerald Tripp. Gerald is renowned in the animation world, and it was very exciting to bring his vision into a reality.</p>
      <p>Five of us third year graphic design students were paired and assigned roles key to the success of the project. I had the position of Team Lead, where I was in charge of client and group communications, setting meeting times and deadlines, as well as handling all final submissions.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>With an amazing team of people well versed in motion graphics, illustration, and branding—we knew we were the team to get this concept off the ground.</strong></p>

      <p>As a group, we chose ten of our favourite sketches each and came together to decide on the strongest. From those 50 sketches, we narrowed it down to a top 4. We decided that we shouldn't develop our own concepts, of the top four I developed Katrin Emery's sketch to present to the client.</p>
      <p>I was lucky to have been the one to expand on Katrin's sketch, as I was primarily the one to develop it throughout and prepared it to be animated. Meeting with the client and working as a team encouraged different design decisions. Throughout the process, our tyrannosaurus rex gained brighter colours, a deeper smile, and playful details and textures. Along the way the static logo dropped the meteor, and had our dino facing a now active volcano.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>From pencil to pixel, this logo was refined and developed for its primary purpose—being animated. </strong></p>
