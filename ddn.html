      <p>This project was founded through Algonquin College's Applied Research Institute (ARI), where we created a proposal to work with Gerald Tripp. Gerald is renowned in the animation world, and it was very exciting to bring his vision into a reality.</p>
      <p>As Team Lead, I was in charge of client and group communications, creating a schedule, setting milestone times and deadlines, as well as processing and handing off all final deliverables.</p>
      <p>We are <em>Designosaurus</em>, joining me was Katrin Emery, MJ Holland, Cecilia Bleszynski, Kait Moore.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>With an amazing team of people well versed in motion graphics, illustration, and branding—we were the team to get this concept off the ground.</strong></p>

      <p>From 50 sketches, we narrowed it down to 4. As a creative tool we decided we wouldn't be the ones to develop our own concept, I developed Katrin Emery's sketch to present to the client.</p>
      <p>I was primarily the one to develop it throughout and prepared it to be animated.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>From pencil to pixel, this logo was refined and developed for its primary purpose—being animated.</strong></p>

      <p>Despite the Ontario Colleges strike of 2017, this did not undermine our process. We continued our work and stuck to the schedule, met with our client as normal.</p>
      <p>Our client is a busy man, we didn't get the audio files in time. We had less than a week to deliver the final video <em>and we didn't have any audio for the script.</em> Being resourceful I reached out to a radio and journalism student, Tyler Kidd, who helped us record and edit the audio.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>We're a tenacious group. Putting in the hours, dedication, and hard work this project deserved.</strong></p>
