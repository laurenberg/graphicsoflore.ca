      <p>The Ontario Centre of Excellence focuses in youth mental health services, and every year provides it’s contributors with an Impact Report.</p>
      <p>Youth mental health is extremely important, but it can be a difficult issue to talk about. The Ontario Centre of Excellence needed a <em>light-hearted approach</em> to otherwise very sensitive subject matter.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>In order to make this content easier to digest I had to find a way to present the subject matter in a more approachable way, making it easier to talk about.</strong></p>

      <p>The Ontario Centre of Excellence has a lot to proud of, and their 2016–2017 year had much to boast. This required a comprehensive layout of both the print and web versions of the Impact Report.</p>
      <p>The printed version was just a summary of the full Impact Report available online, so the real challenge of structure came into the navigation of the website. In two of the sections, a sub-navigation was used to divide larger content into more palatable portions.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>Making a cohesive plan for how to organize the content was the most important way to make sure readers absorbed as much information as possible.</strong></p>
