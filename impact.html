        <p>The Ontario Centre of Excellence focuses in youth mental health services, and each year provides contributors with its Impact Report.</p>
        <p>Youth mental health is extremely important, but it can be a difficult issue to talk about. The Ontario Centre of Excellence needed a <em>welcoming appearance</em> to address a sensitive topic.</p>

      <div class="unit 1-2-3 m-2-3 s-1">
        <p>The Ontario Centre of Excellence has a lot to proud of, their report was extensive. This required a comprehensive layout of both the print and web versions of the Impact Report.</p>
        <p>The printed version was a summary of the full Impact Report available online, so the real challenge was the structure of the website navigation. A custom sub-navigation was used to divide larger content into more palatable portions.</p>
        <p class="em giga"><strong>Making a cohesive plan to organize the content was critical in making sure readers absorbed as much information as possible.</strong></p>
