      <p>Hi there! I'm Lore.</p>
      <p>Getting into graphic design didn’t come naturally. I have a background in fine art and concept art; and after not finding professional success pursuing these paths, I always told myself I couldn’t have a career being creative.</p>
      <p>My first mistake was thinking being a creative needed to surround fine art.</p>
      <p>It was 3 in the morning on the first day of school, when I applied to the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. I was very late—and very lucky—but after a look at the portfolio I had less than a day to prepare, I found myself in a community that would change my life.</p>
