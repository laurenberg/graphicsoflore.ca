      <h2>spot of bother</h2>
      <p>The existing Map of Operations didn’t only need a visual update, there were also issues with readability. The colours and texture used on the original map made it very hard to read the 6pt. condensed typeface used across it.</p>
      <p>The previous designer also left their working file in an unusable way, since the internal communications department of Canadian Blood Services only worked with interns for their graphic design work, this meant that files needed to be usable beyond my internship.</p>

      <p>While interviewing people at the head office, I discovered that there were several cities illustrated on the map that had more than one collection site. The existing map didn't show the differences in the legend, making it impossible to differentiate the different facilities in specific cities, and what services they offered.</p>
      <p>All icons needed to be unique to what they represented, and readable at a very small size.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="unit l-1-3 m-1-3 s-1 island">
      <p>I used symbols for each of the legend icons. This way, you can edit every icon in the document with a single click. I also used an organized layer structure and colour palette, so anyone working on the files after my internship wouldn't have any troubles.</p>

      <p>This map was designed during Canada’s 150 celebrations. To add a little something special, I added several elements of Canadiana across the map. From Canadian animals—beaver, moose, orca whales—to the Parliament Buildings, totem poles, and the CN Tower. These can all be easily hidden when Canada’s 150 celebrations come to a close.</p>
