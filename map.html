        <p>The existing Map of Operations didn’t only need a visual update, there were also readability issues. The colour and texture used on the original map made it hard to read the <em>6pt. condensed typeface</em> used across it.</p>
        <p>The previous working file was unusable. To make sure anyone could update the map as needed—while maintaining continuity—I needed to organize my files in a comprehensive way.</p>
        <p class="em giga"><strong>First and foremost the updated map needed to be legible and attractive. Employees need to be drawn to a topic that might otherwise seem mundane.</strong></p>

        <p>I discovered there were several cities illustrated on the map that had more than one collection site. The existing legend did not show the differences, making it impossible to differentiate the facilities in specific cities.</p>
        <p>I used symbols for each of the legend icons. This way, you can edit each icon in the document with <em>a single action.</em> I also used an organized layer structure and colour palette, so anyone can make adjustments with ease.</p>
        <p class="em giga"><strong>All legend icons needed to be identifiable even at small sizes.</strong></p>

        <p>This map was designed during Canada’s 150 celebrations. To add a little something special, I illustrated several elements of Canadiana across the map. These can all be easily hidden when Canada’s 150 celebrations come to a close.</p>
