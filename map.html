      <h2 class="iskra pad-b">Spot of bother</h2>
      <p>The existing Map of Operations didn’t only need a visual update, there were also readability issues. The colours and texture used on the original map made it very <em>hard to read</em> the 6pt. condensed typeface used across it.</p>
      <p>The previous designer also left their working file in an unusable way, since the internal communications department of Canadian Blood Services <em>only</em> worked with interns for their graphic design work, this meant that files needed to be usable beyond my internship.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>First and foremost, the map needed to be legible and attractive. People need to be interested in a topic that might otherwise seem mundane to the employees at Canadian Blood Services.</strong></p>

      <p>While interviewing people at the head office, I discovered that there were several cities illustrated on the map that had more than one collection site. The existing map didn't show the differences in the legend, making it impossible to differentiate the different facilities in specific cities.</p>
      <p>I used symbols for each of the legend icons. This way, you can edit every icon in the document with <em>a single action.</em> I also used an organized layer structure and colour palette; this way, any interns or employees could make adjustments with ease.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>All icons needed to be unique to what they represented, and readable at a very small size.</strong></p>

      <p>This map was designed during Canada’s 150 celebrations. To add a little something special, I illustrated several elements of Canadiana across the map. From Canadian animals—a beaver, moose, and orca whales—to the Parliament Buildings, a totem pole, and the CN Tower. These can all be easily hidden when Canada’s 150 celebrations come to a close.</p>
