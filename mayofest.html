      <p class="intro">Mayofest—a music festival in Mayo, Quebec—was in need of a new brand. So they called on their community to help find a new logo and identity.</p>

      <p>Mayofest is the not-for-profit go-to place for camping, music, and general good times. When they announced they were starting a contest to find a new logo, I couldn't wait to participate and show them what a brand could do for their vision.</p>
      <p>The once cottage party has truly taken on an identity of its own. It’s the most spirited, wild, and welcoming festival myself—and many others—have ever been a part of.</p>
      <p class="giga em"><strong>The thing that stands out the most is the strong sense of community.</strong></p>

      <p>Everything is connected by the pennant banner. This shows the connection and sense of community unique to Mayofest. The look is classic to Mayofest, but representative of the kind of atmosphere expected at this festive event.</p>
      <p>Besides trying to capture the character of Mayofest, it’s also important viewers know right away what the main attractions are. These are visualized in the A and the Y of the logo, showing a tent and a guitar making it very clear that this is the place to be for camping and great music.</p>

      <p>As a not-for-profit, it is important that the brand has a strong professional appearance for potential investors.</p>
      <p>There is a very dedicated community behind Mayofest, and they have a very <em>saucy</em> sense of humour. Many would call it crass, and it's definitely vulgar. Their motto—which is written on staff shirts—is "Don't F#$! up!"</p>
      <p>This one of a kind community, even though they are getting a more mature logo, needed to keep that true sense of Mayofest. This is where the concept of the <em>inside joke</em> came in.</p>
      <p class="em giga"><strong>These cheeky double entendres cater to the sense of humour that makes Mayofest, and the Mayofesters who attend, unique.</strong></p>

      <p>As a not-for-profit, it’s important that the merch is as exciting as the event itself. This way, Mayofest is getting the funds they need to keep expanding.</p>
      <p>Since glass isn’t allowed on the grounds and plastic is discouraged, people have to bring their own cups for drinks on the site.</p>
      <p class="giga em"><strong>Since Mayofesters are environmentally conscious, the perfect keepsake to any Mayo event would be a reusable camping mug or cup.</strong></p>
